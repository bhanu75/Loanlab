## üí∞ Top Project: Financial Calculator Suite (EMI + Investment)

**Problem I Solved:** Indian families struggle with complex financial decisions - EMI calculations from banks are unclear, investment options are confusing, and most calculators are built for finance experts, not regular people.

**My Solution:** Built a comprehensive financial planning suite with two integrated calculators that speak in simple Hindi/English, show real comparisons, and help people make informed money decisions.

**Key Innovation - Payment Visualization:** Unlike other EMI calculators that just show final numbers, mine shows **payment trends over time** with interactive charts. Users can see exactly how much principal vs interest they're paying each year - this was my biggest technical challenge and most valuable feature.

**Real User Impact:**
- Users requested Hindi language support (implemented)
- Feedback: "Finally understand what my bank was hiding in EMI calculations"
- Balance transfer feature helped users save thousands by comparing loans
- WhatsApp sharing makes it easy to discuss with family

**Technical Architecture:**
- **React + TypeScript:** Chose for type safety in financial calculations - money math cannot have bugs
- **Recharts:** Selected for smooth chart performance with large loan datasets (20+ year amortizations)
- **Mobile-First Design:** Financial decisions happen on phones, not laptops
- **Compound Logic:** Implemented IRR calculations for investment comparisons (different from simple interest)

**Advanced Features:**
- **Loan Comparison:** Multiple simultaneous loan scenarios with visual comparisons
- **Investment Planning:** FD, RD, PPF, Insurance with 3-scenario projections (conservative/optimal/best case)
- **Indian Context:** Proper tax benefit calculations, currency formatting, inflation impact
- **Smart Recommendations:** Income-based affordability analysis, prepayment impact calculations

**Technical Challenges Solved:**
- **Complex Date Math:** Handled leap years, different month lengths in amortization schedules
- **Chart Performance:** Optimized rendering for 20+ year loan data without lag
- **Responsive Tables:** Made complex financial data readable on mobile screens

## üíß Second Project: NaalTrack - Water Supply Tracker

**Personal Problem Solved:** In Udaipur, government water comes alternate days, but I kept forgetting the schedule while traveling. Empty tanks = frustrated family.

**Simple Solution:** Set last supply date once ‚Üí app predicts next 7 days automatically. No login, works offline, mobile-optimized.

**User Adoption:** Shared publicly, users requested payment gateway for water bills (shows real usage)

**Technical Decisions:**
- **localStorage over Database:** People want quick answers, not passwords
- **React + Vite:** Fast development cycle for simple but effective solution
- **PWA-ready:** Notifications and offline capability

**Growth Mindset:** Planning to expand to water, gas, and electricity tracking based on user feedback.

## üß† How I Think as a Developer

**User-First Philosophy:** I don't build features because they're cool - I build them because people need them. My EMI calculator's "payment over time" visualization came from personally struggling to understand loan breakdowns.

**Indian Market Focus:** Most financial tools are built for Western markets. I design for Indian families who make decisions together, need Hindi support, and want to share calculations on WhatsApp.

**Technical Decisions:** TypeScript for financial accuracy, React for maintainability, mobile-first always. I avoid over-engineering - when localStorage solves it, I don't force a database.

**Quality Over Speed:** Financial calculations must be bulletproof. I'd rather spend extra time on edge cases than ship broken math.
