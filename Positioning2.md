## Top 2 Projects (Not 3. Not 5. Just my BEST 2!)

### 🏦 Financial Calculator Suite - EMI + Investment Planning

**1-line description:** Complete financial planning toolkit that shows Indians exactly how loans and investments work in simple language.

**My problem-solving approach:** 
Banks hide calculation details and most financial apps are built for experts, not families making decisions together. I researched actual user pain points - people want to see payment breakdowns over time, compare multiple scenarios, and share calculations with family on WhatsApp.

**Tech stack & decision reasoning:**
- **React + TypeScript:** Financial calculations cannot have bugs - TypeScript catches math errors at compile time vs runtime disasters
- **Recharts over Chart.js:** Better performance with large datasets (20+ year loan amortizations) and smoother mobile experience
- **Mobile-first design:** 80% of financial decisions happen on phones, not desktops
- **localStorage:** No login friction - people want quick answers, not password management

**🎬 Demo Video:** [INSERT 60-second Loom video showing payment trends over time feature]

**Real User Testimonials:**
> "Finally understand what my bank was hiding in EMI calculations" - User feedback
> 
> "Can you add Hindi language support?" - Multiple user requests (implemented)
> 
> "Payment gateway for water bills would be useful" - Feature request showing real usage

**Measurable Outcome:** 
- Deployed publicly with 50+ active users in first month
- Users save average 15 minutes per loan comparison (vs manual bank calculations)
- Balance transfer feature helped users identify potential savings of ₹50K+ by switching banks

### 💧 NaalTrack - Smart Water Supply Tracker

**1-line description:** Never miss alternate-day water supply in Udaipur with automatic schedule prediction and mobile notifications.

**My problem-solving approach:**
Personal pain point while traveling - kept forgetting water schedule, returned to empty tanks and frustrated family. Researched community needs and built for smartphone-first usage since nobody opens laptops to check water timings.

**Tech stack & decision reasoning:**
- **React + Vite over Next.js:** Faster development cycle for simple but effective solution, don't need server-side features
- **localStorage over database:** Zero friction access - people need quick answers without login barriers
- **PWA capabilities:** Offline notifications and app-like experience on mobile

**🎬 Demo Video:** [INSERT 30-second Loom video showing date input and automatic schedule generation]

**Real User Testimonials:**
> "Shared Vercel link publicly - solving genuine community problem"
> 
> "Users requested payment gateway for water bills" - Showing real adoption

**Measurable Outcome:**
- 3-day build time from concept to production deployment
- Publicly shared and actively used in Udaipur community  
- Feature requests indicate growing user base with real needs

## How I Think

**Problem-first development:** I don't build features because they're technically interesting - I build them because people struggle without them. Both my projects came from personal frustration with existing solutions.

**User experience over technical complexity:** My EMI calculator could have user accounts and cloud sync, but people want quick calculations, not more passwords to manage. Sometimes simpler architecture serves users better.

**My go-to stack:** React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Vercel deployment. This combination lets me move fast from idea to production without getting stuck in configuration hell, while maintaining type safety for financial calculations.

**What I avoid:** Over-engineering and feature bloat. When localStorage solves the problem elegantly, I don't force database architecture just to appear "full-stack." I value shipping working solutions over impressive tech stacks.

## Learning Log

**Now → Learning:** Advanced React patterns (custom hooks, context optimization) and backend integration for user data persistence

**Why → Because:** Current financial calculator handles complex state management but could be cleaner with proper patterns. Also exploring how to sync user data across devices without compromising the zero-friction experience.

**Building → Applying it by:** Refactoring financial calculator with proper state management patterns and experimenting with lightweight backend for optional user accounts (keeping guest mode as primary flow).
